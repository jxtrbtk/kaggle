## LANL-Earthquake-Prediction [>>>](https://github.com/jxtrbtk/kaggle/tree/master/LANL-Earthquake-Prediction)
Forecasting earthquakes for Los Alamos Nationl Laboratory.

I've used this dataset for the capstone project of the IBM Coursera certified specialization "Advanced Data Science with IBM".
All the work has been done following a methodology (the Lightweight IBM Cloud Garage Method for Data Science) and I've published the following parts : 
- Initial Data exploration
- ETL
- Features Engineering
- Model Definition

One of the interest of the project was to use the **Apache Spark** service of the IBM cloud.
